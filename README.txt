A little project exploring controlling ICSP on my LVP.

Here's proof that it works: https://www.facebook.com/jvschang/videos/vb.685136948/10152624879256949

Essentially, I bought a MiniPro, but it didn't support the chip I wanted to program...so I decided to replace the firmware with my own.  This is one step towards realizing that, but I haven't really had time to work on it in a while.

Demonstrates C and USB programming, and that I can solder a little bit here and there (watch the vid)
